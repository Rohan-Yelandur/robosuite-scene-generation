KEY INSIGHTS:
================================================================================

🔴 CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES (≥70% failure rate):
   • Resize the box to dimensions 0.2 0.8 0.025 (Length, Breadth, Height). (100.0% - 48/48 uses)

   • Change the robot color to blue. (27.0% - 24/89 uses)
   • Resize the cylinder to dimensions 0.03 0.1 (Height, Radius). (12.5% - 12/96 uses)
   • Resize the cylinder to dimensions 0.02 0.13 (Height, Radius). (20.0% - 1/5 uses)
   • Change the robot color to green. (0.0% - 0/12 uses)
   • Change the cylinder color to red. (17.5% - 50/286 uses)
   • Change the lighting color to gray. (0.0% - 0/1 uses)

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY IMPROVEMENT:
================================================================================

1. DOMAIN RANDOMIZATION:
   Focus training data augmentation on the top 3 failure modes.

2. TARGETED DATA COLLECTION:
   Collect additional demonstrations under critical failure conditions.

3. FINE-TUNING:
   Fine-tune the policy specifically on scenarios involving:
      1) Resize the box to dimensions 0.2 0.8 0.025 (Length, Breadth, Height). (100.0% failure rate)
      2) Change the lighting color to red. (100.0% failure rate)
      3) Change the lighting color to green. (100.0% failure rate)

4. RE-EVALUATION:
   After retraining, run RoboMD again to verify failure modes are reduced.
   Success = more uniform probability distribution across all actions.
